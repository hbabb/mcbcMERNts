# Project Journal and Miscellaneous Notes

## Entry Date: September 18, 2024

I setup the backend config with a db.ts and pulled that into the server.ts for
the backend. I completed setting up the server.ts. I need to add routes to the
server.ts as they are completed.

I have files setup for API routes, and started setting up the blogRoutes. I
setup the blog model. I need to complete the models and controllers for the
backend and finish the API routes. I need to compile tests for the models,
controllers, and routes.

I will add documentation as I complete teach tasks and phase of the project. I
also plan to add these tasks (issues) to a Notion project board. I will mostly
copy all documentation into a Notion Wiki as well for future reference.

### Summary

- Changed backend/server.ts to backend/index.ts
- Added models to the backend
- Began working on controller for Blogs
- Setup typedoc for project
- Added TSDoc comments to controller with codeium AI assistant

### Notes

Note to self, ChatGPT is horrible and getting worse. I am considering dropping
the subscription and picking up a subscription to Claude instead. I wish Codeium
had a browser version like ChatGPT and Claude.

I am going to continue working on getting the backend setup and using Codeium to
help with comments. I will run the typedoc command on a regular basis to create
rough documentation. Once I have the backend setup and documented, I am
considering setting up Docusaurus or MKDocs or similar documentation tools and
refactoring my documentation from the typedoc format.

### Next Steps

- Continue to setup the backend controllers, models, and routes
- Connect the backend with MongoDB and build an Admin panel in the frontend to
  access the backend and manage the database
- Add documentation for the project
- Connect the frontend with the backend
- Build the frontend with React
